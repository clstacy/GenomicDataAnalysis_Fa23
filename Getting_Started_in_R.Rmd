# Getting things setup

The following code installs a set of R packages used in this document -- if not already installed -- and then loads the packages into R. Note that we utilize the US CRAN repository, but other repositories may be more convenient according to geographic location.

```{r ready-packages results="hide",message=FALSE}

list.of.packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "knitr", "BiocManager")

new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages,repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
lapply(list.of.packages, require, character.only = TRUE)

#remotes::install_github("rstudio/webshot2",quiet=T)
# devtools::install_github("ropensci/USAboundaries",quiet=T)
# devtools::install_github("ropensci/USAboundariesData",quiet=T)

#library(webshot2)
#library(mapview)
#library(USAboundaries)

```


# Description

# Learning outcomes

At the end of this excercise, you should be able to:

  - open, modify, and knit an Rmd file to a pdf/html output
  - relate Rmarkdown to a traditional lab notebook
  - run commands in an Rmarkdown file

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r using-codeChunk}
# print a statement
print("R code in a .Rmd chunk works just like a script")

# preform basic calculations
2+2
```



```{r access-data}
# setting the working directory
#setwd("~/Documents/GitHub/GenomicDataAnalysis_Fa23")

# check where R here currently is looking
here::dr_here()

# create a directory for raw data to be stored.
dir.create(here("data"))
dir.create(here("code"))
dir.create(here("docs"))
dir.create(here("figures"))
dir.create(here("results"))

# assign url to a variable
eaglesWV.url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brouwern/wildlifeR/master/inst/extdata/eaglesWV.csv"

"https://github.com/hartwigmedical/testdata/blob/master/100k_reads_hiseq/TESTX/TESTX_H7YRLADXX_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz"

# download data from web
eaglesWV <- read_csv(eaglesWV.url)

write_csv()
```

```{r}

```
