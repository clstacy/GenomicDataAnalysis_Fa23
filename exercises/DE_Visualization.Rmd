set.seed("1492")
```

# Getting Things Setup

As usual, make sure we have the right packages for this exercise

```{r ready-packages, results="hide",message=FALSE}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman"); library(pacman)

# let's load all of the files we were using and want to have again today
p_load("tidyverse", "knitr", "readr",
       "pander", "BiocManager", 
       "dplyr", "stringr", 
       "purrr", # for working with lists (beautify column names)
       "reactable") # for pretty tables.

# We also need these Bioconductor packages today.
p_load("DESeq2", "edgeR", "AnnotationDbi", "org.Sc.sgd.db", "Glimma")
```

# Description



# Learning outcomes

At the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

-   Visualize Differential Expression Results


```{r load-libraries}
library(DESeq2)
library(org.Sc.sgd.db)
# for ease of use, set max number of digits after decimal
options(digits=3)
```
